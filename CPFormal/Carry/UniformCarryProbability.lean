# Uniform probability of a positional carry event

At depth `k`, the residue space of a base-`b` camera has exactly `b^k`
equiprobable classes.  A specified carry condition is one congruence class,
so its finite uniform probability is `1 / b^k`.

This module proves that statement as a cardinality calculation and then
identifies it with the already formalized carry mass `b^(-k)`.  The proof uses
only `0 < b`; no primality assumption enters.

Uniform Carry Probability Law.

For every positive positional base and every depth, the probability of a
specified carry congruence class is exactly the carry mass `b^(-k)`.
